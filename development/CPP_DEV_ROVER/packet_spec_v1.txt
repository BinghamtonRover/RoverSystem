=== [ Version 1 ] ===

This file describes the specification of the rover packet protocol, of version listed above.


==========
= Basics =
==========

The protocol uses UDP over IP. Each application-level packet is sent as a single UDP packet. 
The UDP buffer must be at least the length of the longest packet. This will ensure that all
packets can be read in a single UDP read. All packets must use big-endian byte ordering.

The protocol version is a positive integer which increments each time the packet protocol is
changed. The base station and the rover should only accept packets of the latest version, to
prevent confusion. In order to avoid breaking implementations, the Version field of the packet
header (defined below) MUST be the first field in every packet in every version of the
protocol.


=================
= Packet Header =
=================

All packets share a common header. The format is as follows:

| (Field Name)  | (Field Type)      | (Field Size, in Bytes)    |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
| Version       | unsigned short    | 2                         |
| Packet Type   | unsigned byte     | 1                         |
| Timestamp     | unsigned short    | 2                         |

* Version:      Specifies the protocol version in use. This is to aid debugging and to prevent
                mismatched versions.
* Packet Type:  Specifies the type of the packet. The fields in the remaining bytes of the packet
                are fixed depending on this type. The value used for each packet type is listed
                below with the definition of each packet.
* Timestamp:    This is not to be confused with a Unix timestamp. This value must be incremented
                by one for every packet sent by both the rover and the base station. This is to
                ensure packet order. Implementations should record the timestamp of the last packet
                they receieved and processed, and ignore any incoming packets with a timestamp value 
                less than that of the last packet received. When an implementation assigns the last
                available value of an unsigned short (the decimal value 65535), the next packet sent
                should have the timestamp of 0, and the incrementing per-packet should repeat. If an
                implementation receives a packet with a timestamp of 0, it must accept the packet
                regardless of the timestamp of the last received packet. The base station and the rover
                should keep their own timestamp counters; there should be no attempt to syncronize.

The body of the packet must follow immediately after the packet header.

> Type 0 is reserved.

> Type 1: Control Packet

The control packet is used to send instruction state to the rover. These will be sent from base station
to rover at some fixed or variable rate. All fields must be specified in each packet.

| (Field Name)      | (Field Type)      | (Field Size, in Bytes)    |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
| Movement State    | unsigned byte     | 1                         |

* Movement State:   Specifies how the rover must be moving. It must be one of the following values:
                        - 0 (STOP): The rover is at a standstill.
                        - 1 (FORWARD): The rover is moving forward.
                        - 2 (LEFT): The rover is turning left.
                        - 3 (RIGHT): The rover is turning right.
                    The state must remain for the duration of the command. For instance, if the rover
                    is to move forward while a controller button is held, then the FORWARD value must
                    be specified in every control packet sent while the button is held. When the button
                    is released and the rover is expected to stop, the STOP value will be specified in
                    every control packet sent until another button is pressed.
