# Branch Summary

We took the branch from Bluetooth Demo and went through it and
made it work. Now able to establish a connection between two pc via bluetooth
and exchange strings one at a time (If you scrambled the sequence the program 
will glitch out). We kinda started on the GUI but could not finish it. 
We have an idea for multi-client connection but am not sure.

The blueCove 2.1.1 library imported by maven dosen't seems to work. 
It needs to be externally downloaded and imported.

Also there is a unknown issue of using this library on Mac.
