# Observer and Obervables 
- Here is the scenario: You are the owner of a recent startup online cabbage supplier. One random day, there was a sudden influx of orders and you're out of cabbages. You deicde to implement a button on your website to allow customers to be notified when the stock of cabbages have been replenished.

## Things to note
- I decided to create my own observer (Customer) and observable (CabbageStock) class. You can see what I did in the cabbagepkg folder.

### How it works
- The program will continuously ask you for a input (a number) and will check if the number is greater than zero. If true, then it will notify the customers. Otherwise, it will not notify the customers. You can exit the program by doing `CRTL C`.
