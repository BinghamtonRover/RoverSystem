# Observer and Obervables 
- Here is the scenario: You are the owner of a recent startup online cabbage supplier. One random day, there was a sudden influx of orders and you're out of cabbages. You deicde to implement a button on your website to allow customers to be notified when the stock of cabbages have been replenished.

## Things to note
- None lol :)

### How it works
- The program will continuously check if the readme.md file (this file) has been modified. If true, then it will notify the customers; Otherwise, it will not notify the customers. You can exit the program by doing `CRTL C`.
