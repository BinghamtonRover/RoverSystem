## Identifies the network interface connected to the basestation-rover local network.
## The interface is identified by this computer's IP address on that network.
## 
## If both the base station and rover programs are run on the same computer, this can
## be left unset. However, if the programs are running on two different machines,
## this must be set to ensure that the multicast groups are opened on the correct network.
## 
## On the actual basestation-rover network and hardware, this should be the assigned
## static IP address of the rover.
