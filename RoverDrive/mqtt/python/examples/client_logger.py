# This shows a simple example of standard logging with an MQTT subscriber client.

import context  # Ensures paho is in PYTHONPATH
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# If you want to use a specific client id, use
# mqttc = mqtt.Client("client-id")
# but note that the client id must be unique on the broker. Leaving the client
# id parameter empty will generate a random id for you.
mqttc = mqtt.Client()

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
mqttc.enable_logger(logger)

mqttc.connect("mqtt.eclipseprojects.io", 1883, 60)
mqttc.subscribe("$SYS/#", 0)

mqttc.loop_forever()
