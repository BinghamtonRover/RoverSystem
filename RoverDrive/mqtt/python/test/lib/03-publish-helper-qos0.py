# Test whether a client sends a correct PUBLISH to a topic with QoS 0.
# Use paho.mqtt.publish helper for that.

# The client should connect to port 1888 with keepalive=60, clean session set,
# and client id publish-helper-qos0-test
# The test will send a CONNACK message to the client with rc=0. Upon receiving
# the CONNACK and verifying that rc=0, the client should send a PUBLISH message
# to topic "pub/qos0/test" with payload "message" and QoS=0. If rc!=0, the
# client should exit with an error.
# After sending the PUBLISH message, the client should send a
# DISCONNECT message.
