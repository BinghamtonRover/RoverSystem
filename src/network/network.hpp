/*
    This library provides network support with a custom protocol over UDP.
    For more information about the protocol, the spec can be found in the docs folder of the repository.

    Here is an example program:

    ```
    int main() {
        // Allocate a connection.
        // This struct holds all information about a single socket. To use multiple sockets, create multiple
   connections. network::Connection conn;

        network::Error error;
        // Connect to the network library running on 192.168.1.1:45545. Open local port 45545.
        if ((error = network::connect(&conn, "192.168.1.1", 45545, 45545)) != network::Error::OK) {
            fprintf(stderr, "[!] Failed to connect to rover!\n");
            return 1;
        }

        // The network library is designed to be invoked in a main loop.
        while (true) {
            // First, process incoming packets in the kernel packet queue.
            network::poll_incoming(&conn);

            // Allocate a message struct to receive each message that just arrived.
            network::Message message;

            // dequeue_incoming returns false when there are no more messages to be processed.
            while (network::dequeue_incoming(&conn, &message)) {

                // Check what type of message this is and handle it accordingly.
                switch (message.type) {

                    case network::MessageType::HEARTBEAT:

                        // This message doesn't have a body, so it doesn't need to be read.
                        // To send a message, first get a buffer. Don't allocate these yourself!
                        network::Buffer* outgoing = network::get_outgoing_buffer();

                        // This puts the message on a queue. The message will be sent on the next drain_outgoing call.
                        // The HEARTBEAT packet in this example doesn't have any data, so we didn't write anything to
   the buffer. network::queue_outgoing(&conn, network::MessageType::HEARTBEAT, outgoing); break;

                    case network::MessageType::ECHO:

                        // This message type has some data in it, assume its a string variable 'str'.
                        // So we can create a struct which represents one and call deserialize on the buffer that came
   with the incoming message! network::EchoMessage echo; network::deserialize(message.buffer, &echo);

                        // In this example, our ECHO reverses the characters it receives in str.
                        // ... Reverse the characters in echo.str ...

                        // To send, first get an outgoing buffer.
                        network::Buffer* outgoing = network::get_outgoing_buffer();

                        // Serialize our reply, which includes the reversed string.
                        network::serialize(outgoing, &echo);

                        // Place the message on a queue to be sent later.
                        network::queue_outgoing(&conn, network::MessageType::ECHO, outgoing);
                        break;
                }

                // Make sure to always return the message buffer when you are finished with it!
                network::return_incoming_buffer(message.buffer);
            }

            // This must be called once per main loop. It sends all queued messages.
            network::drain_outgoing(&conn);
        }
    }
    ```

    This library follows the natural programmatic symmetry of read data, operate on the data, and output the data. As
   such, your main loop networking code will contain some helpful symmetry:

        At the top of your loop, a call to poll_incoming will read packets off the wire...
        ... and at the bottom, drain_outgoing will write packets to the wire.

        Between poll_incoming and drain_outgoing, calls to dequeue_incoming read messages out of the received packets...
        ... and queue_outgoing puts messages into packets.

        A call to dequeue_incoming provides a Buffer, which must be returned with return_incoming_buffer...
        ... and a Buffer can be obtained from get_outgoing_buffer and is returned with queue_outgoing.

    This library is NOT complete. Right now, it can sends and receives fixed-length messages and handles acknowledgement
   and order-sensitivity. It is missing the following:
        - Session/connection status: there is currently no concept of a real connection.
        - Network statistics: we are not recording bandwidth, packet loss, etc.
        - Repeated messages: the library currently does not discard repeat incoming messages.
        - Variable length messages: currently, each message must be the size that its type mandates.
        - A way to get a descriptive string from an error code.

    This macro gives us the ability to:

        (b) Interpret bytes at an arbitrary location of a byte buffer as an arbitrary type.
    Parameters:
        thing: the byte buffer. Always a uint8_t* for our purposes.
        idx: the byte index into the buffer.
        type: the type being inserted or removed.
    Examples:
        (a) Placing a 32-bit integer into a byte buffer at byte position 7:
            VALUE(buffer, 7, int32_t) = -12344454;
        (b) Interpreting two bytes at byte buffer position 3 as an unsigned 16-bit integer:
            uint16_t my_int = VALUE(buffer, 3, uint16_t);
